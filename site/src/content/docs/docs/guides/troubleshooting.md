## Chrome blocked local network access

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
The page at `droid.devpier.dev` connects to the gateway on your own Mac. Chrome asks for permission the first time. If you denied it, the page cannot connect, and after a few failed attempts it tells you that Chrome blocked access to your Mac.

To allow it again:

1. Open Chrome **Settings → Privacy and security → Site settings**.
2. Find `droid.devpier.dev` and allow local network access.
3. Reload the page.

If you still cannot connect, use the [local fallback page](#use-the-local-fallback-page).

## Port already in use

The gateway listens on port `7300` by default.

If the gateway runs in the background, running the command again restarts it. If a gateway runs in a Terminal window, the command does not start a second one: it says droidpier is already running on port `7300`. Stop that one with `Ctrl+C`, then run the command again.

If another program uses the port, the gateway says so, suggests another port, and exits. Find the program:

```sh
lsof -nP -iTCP:7300 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Stop that program, or start the gateway on another port:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://droid.devpier.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --port 7301
```

After the install, `droidpier --port 7301` does the same.

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
The gateway puts the new port in the address it opens, so the page connects to the right port.

## No emulator found

If the page says no running emulator was found:

- Check that an emulator is running: `adb devices` should list `emulator-5554` or similar.
- Check that it was started with gRPC enabled (`-grpc <port>`). The gateway cannot read the screen of an emulator without gRPC.

<!-- verify: phase 2 -->
You can also start a device from the list in the page. See [Devices](/docs/guides/devices/).

The gateway keeps running when no emulator is found, and prints the reason: in Terminal, or in its log when it runs in the background (`droidpier logs`).

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
If the gateway reports that `emulator`, `platform-tools`, a system image or a device is missing, finish the setup on the page. See [First run](/docs/getting-started/first-run/#2-let-it-check-your-android-sdk).

## A device's system image is missing

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
If you removed a system image, for example in Android Studio, the devices that use it cannot start. The page names each of those devices and the Android version it is missing, and offers to install that image again. One device that can start is enough: the page stops asking once any device has its system image.

## An install fails

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
The page shows the reason under the item. If a download does not match the checksum Google publishes, nothing is unpacked; install the item again. If no data arrives for a minute, the download stops; check your network connection and try again. Droidpier does not need Java or the command line tools, so a missing `sdkmanager` is not a problem.

## The page does not connect

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
The page checks for the gateway once a second and connects as soon as it answers. If it keeps waiting:

- Run `droidpier status` to check that the gateway runs. If it does not, run `droidpier start`. `droidpier logs` shows why it stopped.
- Check that Chrome allows local network access for `droid.devpier.dev`. See [Chrome blocked local network access](#chrome-blocked-local-network-access).
- If you started the gateway with `--port`, open the address it printed, which ends in `#port=<port>`.
- Bring the tab to the front. The page does not check while the tab is in the background.

## The install command fails

- **Checksum failed:** the download did not match its checksum, so nothing was installed. Run the command again.
- **Cannot reach the download site:** if Droidpier is already installed, the command warns you and starts the copy you have. If it is not installed yet, check your internet connection and run the command again.

## The page says the gateway or the page is out of date

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
- **Gateway out of date:** run the upgrade command the page shows. It is the same as the [install command](/docs/getting-started/install/).
- **Page out of date:** force-reload the page with Cmd+Shift+R.

When the page needs a newer gateway than the one that runs, it says so above the screen. A background gateway updates itself and the page reconnects: see [Automatic updates](/docs/reference/cli/#automatic-updates). A gateway that runs in a Terminal window, or one with automatic updates off, does not: the page shows the install command to copy. If deleting or renaming a device fails because the gateway is too old, run the install command too.

## Wrong browser

<!-- verify: phase 3 -->
The page works only in Chrome and Edge. In other browsers it asks you to switch and does not try to connect. See [Browser support](/docs/reference/browser-support/).

## Use the local fallback page

The gateway serves the same page at `http://127.0.0.1:7300/app/` (or the port you chose). Use it when the public page does not load or local network access was denied.

Run `droidpier --local` to have the gateway open the local page instead of the public one.

## The screen stops updating

If the emulator exits or restarts, the page shows that it is disconnected. The gateway keeps running. When the emulator comes back, the page reconnects and the screen returns.

## Uninstall

Stop the background gateway, then delete the files it uses:

```sh
droidpier stop
rm ~/.local/bin/droidpier
rm -r ~/.local/share/droidpier ~/Library/Logs/Droidpier
```

If `droidpier` is already deleted but the background gateway still runs or starts when you log in, remove it by hand:

```sh
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/dev.devpier.droidpier
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.devpier.droidpier.plist
```
